                <p> Welcome to Mole National Park (pronounced Moh-lay'), the nature lover's treasure trove! Located
                    within the Savannaland Tourism Destination Area, Mole is Ghana's first, largest and most prestigious
                    protected area. historical and cultural values.

            <h2>Elmina Castle</h2>
            <br>
            <div class="title-overlay">
                <p> Elmina Castle (St George's Castle), a Unesco heritage site, was built as a trading post by the
                    Portuguese in 1482, and captured by the Dutch in 1637. It was expanded when slaves replaced gold as
                    the major object of
                    commerce, with storerooms converted into dungeons. The informative tour (included in the entry fee)
                    takes you to the grim dungeons, punishment cells, Door of No Return and the turret room where the
                    British imprisoned the Ashanti king, Prempeh I, for four years.
                <p> Elmina Castle was the first trading post built on the Gulf of Guinea, so is the oldest European
                    building
                    in existence in suib-Saharan Africa. Elmina is also a picturesque fishing town along Ghana’s coast,
                    not
                    far from Cape Coast. It is home to one of Ghana's biggest attractions, St George’s Castle. Built by
                    the
                    Portuguese in 1482, it was captured by the Dutch 150 years later and became the headquarters of
                    their
                    West Indies Company for the following 250 years.</p>
                <p>Gold exports were soon replaced by slaves and the tours through the dungeons will give you a good
                    idea of how gruesome a trade it was. The Castle houses a small museum and guided tours are
                    available. The stark beauty of the white-washed Castle walls contrast deeply with the dark history
                    of this place.
                    Fort St Jago lies across the lagoon from the castle, and is worth visiting for the views it offers
                    of the town and Castle.</p>
                <h5>History</h5>
                <p>Renowned as the first major European construction in tropical Africa, St. George's Castle, in the
                    town of
                    Elmina in the Central Region of Ghana, was founded by the Portuguese in 1482.The site of the Castle
                    was
                    selected by Portuguese navigators, as it was advantageously located at the end of a narrow
                    promontory, a
                    stone's throw away from both the Atlantic Ocean and the Benya River. The lee of the low headland
                    provided an excellent natural harbour.
                    St George's Castle or 'Sao Jorge da Mina', after the patron-saint of Portugal, as the castle was
                    known
                    to the Portuguese, afforded the Portuguese a trade monopoly in the area, with unrivalled access to
                    the
                    region's gold. <a href="https://visitghana.com/attractions/elmina-castle/"> Learn more</a>

            <h2>Larabanga Mosque</h2>
            <br>
            <div class="title-overlay">
                <p>The Larabanga Mosque is thought to be the oldest mosque in Ghana and West Africa. It is popularly
                    referred to as the 'Mecca of West Africa, because of its rich historical and architectural values.
                    The
                    dimensions of the mosque are approximately 8m by 8m. The Larabanga Mosque made it to the World
                    Monuments
                    Fund's List of 100 Most Endangered Sites.
                    There is some controversy over when exactly the mosque was built, and who built it. The mosque is
                    thought to date back to 1421. It is believed that an Islamic trader called Ayuba, who was travelling
                    through the area, built the mosque. According to one story, Ayuba slept in the area and had a dream
                    in
                    which he was instructed to build a mosque. When he woke up the next morning, the foundation of the
                    mosque had mysteriously appeared, so he continued with the construction until the mosque was
                    complete. <a href="https://visitghana.com/attractions/larabanga-mosque/">Learn More</a></details>
                </p>
                <h5>Location</h5>
                <p>The mosque is located in the Islamic town of Larabanga, close to Damongo in the West Gonja
                    District of the Savannah Region of Ghana. The town is situated about 15 kilometers north of
                    Damongo, and 4 kilometers south of the Mole National Park entrance.</p>
                <h5>History</h5>
                <p>According to a legend, in 1421, an Islamic trader named Ayuba had a dream while staying here,
                    near a
                    "Mystic Stone", instructing him to build a mosque. </p>
                <p> Strangely, when he awoke, he found that the foundations were already in place and he proceeded to
                    construct the mosque until it was
                    completed. There is a belief that he left instructions that he should be buried close to the
                    mosque and that after three days, the baobab which would shoot up on his grave was to be preserved
                    from generation to generation. The baobab tree next to the mosque today is reputed to mark the site
                    of Ayuba's grave.[2] The townsfolk of Larabanga supposedly depend on the leaves and stem of this
                    baobab tree for healing of ailments.

                    Unlike mosques situated in urban settings in West Africa, the Larabanga Mosque is comparatively
                    small. Rural mosques, like Larabanga's, were usually conceived by a single marabout and loosely
                    based on styles seen elsewhere such as in the Great Mosque of Djenné. In order to achieve a physical
                    resemblance to the architecture used elsewhere, the Larabanga Mosque had to incorporate large
                    buttresses in order to compensate for the poorer quality of building materials.</p>
